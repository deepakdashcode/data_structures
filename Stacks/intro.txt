Stacks allow insertion and deletion of elements from one end only ,called the top of the stack
It follows the LIFO ( Last In First Out ) Principle
It has two operations :
(i) push() [To add an element to top of stack]
(ii) pop() [ To delete the element from the top of stack ]

Terms:
(i) peek --> refers to accessing the topmost value of stack without removing it
(ii) Overflow --> refers to (ERROR) situation when someone tries to push an element to a stack which is already full.
    This occurs when the size of the stack is fixed and there is no more memory left to accommodate the new element
(iii) Underflow --> refers to (ERROR) situation when someone tries to delete an element from a stack when it is already empty
